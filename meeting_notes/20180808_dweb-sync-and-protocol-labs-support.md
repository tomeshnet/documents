1. Workers Co-op (20 min)
    - benhylau's proposal for 2019
    - November 2018 planning session for 2019 operation

## Protocol Labs Support for 2018

- Things discussed include: internationalization, making hardware easily accessible, curriculum collaborations with other third-parties, running this workshop around the world, running this for Protocol Labs as user feedback, making a self-guided version, integrations with other peer-to-peer services, etc.

- In remainder of 2018, USD 5000 to support workshop next-steps immediately (@benhylau wants to take as personal grant and redistribute [SSBC grant-style](https://github.com/benhylau/ssbc-grants-scuttlemesh))

- Since there is an existing grant to support SSB-related work and website for the course already, my hope for the scope of this grant is to support:
    - Remaining work to package workshop for non-technical facilitator that is outside of SSBC grant scope
    - Making hardware easily accessible
    - Curriculum collaborations with other third-parties

## Protocol Labs Support for 2019

- We propose projects, and Protocol Labs see where they can lend support, in the form of:
    - Financial support
    - Developer support
    - Travel support
    - Hardware support

- Some project ideas that came up:
    - IPFS Live Streaming
    - IPFS World Clock
    - IPFS Collaborative Pinning
    - Integration with other platforms
    - Continued development of peer-to-peer workshops
    - _More?_

- benhylau's proposal to how we can do this:
    - benhylau has plans to form a workers co-op in Toronto, independent from Toronto Mesh, with multiple funding sources, in this picture Protocol Labs would be one of them
    - Has had prior discussions with patcon, udit, rob, ansuz
    - Risk to Protocol Labs (and funders in general): will a new team be able to manage projects to completion with the funding?

## Notes

### Decentralized Web Summit

- Have business cards / flyers for events like Dweb
- Meshstream to have two laptops (more clear what it's doing)
- garry on Distributed Gardens:
    - Prototype working well, didn't get to use for Distributed Gardens project, but unrelated to Prototype quality
    - A web UI would be nice
    - Enable IPFS Web UI not just locally (Gateway is enabled but not Web UI)

### Protocol Labs Support

- Discussed culture fit and goal alignment with Protocol Labs as an organization, and people's individual hopes and dreams from benhylau's perspective
- knapsackforhope.org integrations (kind of what we wanted from Outernet way back...)
- dcwalk: IPFS Cluster, possible integration points? benhylau spoke briefly with MHz about Cluster as well during Lab Day (benhylau will investigate)
- This was brought up during our discussions: https://github.com/ipfs/docs

## To Do

- Figure out who is interested in assembling in November, full-time for two weeks, to iron out details about forming this working entity in 2019
- benhylau will proceed to start conversations with Protocol Labs
