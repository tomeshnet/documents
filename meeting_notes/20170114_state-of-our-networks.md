# State of Our Networks Recap

Hard to believe State of Our Networks happened over two weeks ago!

On a Saturday in January we hosted over 40 attendees for a full-day of workshops, presentations and lively conversations!

In the morning we were hands-on with Arduino-driven low power sensor networks and Raspberry Pi mesh nodes. In the afternoon we learned about the history of Toronto's networks and discussed upcoming plans with Toronto Community Networks, EtherMesh, and Toronto Mesh members.

Dr. Zbigniew Stachniak described the role that Canada computing and networks have played in the broader internet, speaking to the role of the [York University Computer Museum](http://www.cs.yorku.ca/museum/) in preserving that history. Lee MacNeill, Director of [Toronto Free-Net](http://www.torfree.net/) spoke to the history of the non-profit ISP and the shifting level of government and municipal interest in supporting access through this sort of endeavour. Dr. Catherine Middleton turned the focus to questions of connection and access in public internet and wireless projects, suggesting the need to move beyond framing them solely as infrastructure. Dr. Karen Louise Smith drew upon community informatics to ask questions about who benefits from these projects, and what forms of equality and inclusion should we be striving for. The [TAO collective](http://tao.ca/) surfaced important histories of local activist communications and questions around the role advocacy could play in building new networks.

Finally, during the afternoon discussions EtherMesh and MeshISP covered a range of policy and regulatory concerns, spending time addressing how new initiative fit in Canada alongside robust networks. Toronto Community Networks discussion remained rooed in the need to _know your community_ as a first step in any initiative. Finally, Toronto Mesh considered the asymmetry of power and production in our roles on the Internet, looking to build out a "Help your Neighbour" initiative to build momentum toward joining a mesh network.

We want to thank everyone who attended, and especially those who spoke, ran a workshop, or volunteered their time. It wouldn't have been a success without you all!
