## Presentation

### Toronto Mesh Background & Context

- **Ben:** Overview of Toronto mesh & what we do here
    - Check out [the timeline!](https://tomesh.net/timeline/)
    - More recently we've been involved in the City's _free wifi project_ (working name)

### Overview of Recent Developments

- **Tim:**
    - Once we began to work with some other organizations we started developing our comprehensive proposal.
        - So far we've been talking with the Toronto Public Library, Cisco, and the city.
        - Everyone's been pretty welcoming!
    - We realized we needed to acquire our own equipment for this task
        - We've applied for funding from the Internet Society to cover some of these costs, we're hoping to recieve about CAD $13,500
    - Free Geek Toronto has agreed to formally make the application to ISOC (because Toronto Mesh is not a legal entitiy)

### Upcomming Activities & Events

- **Tim: We're looking to take on more interested people to help us out!**
    - There are many volunteer opportunities, please get in touch if you're interested!

- **Yurko: Deployment**
    - The first node is usually the most difficult as we need to actually prove ourselves
        - Gotta get permission to use other people's space
    - We've chosen Ubiquiti for the "supernode" hardware
    - The first deployment will be atop 200 Woolner Ave (Jane & Dundas)
        - We're hoping to reach up to 2.5k around the building!
        - Going to deploy four Ubiquiti LAB 120 antennas
        - Will be internet connected thanks to the Cisco deployment also happening at the location
        - Some points of interest with this deployment: [HackLab.to](https://hacklab.to/) & the [Jane / Dundas TPL branch](https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/janedundas/)
    - Cisco is planning on installing 2 more areas and we're happy to follow them as long as we have the resources to do so
    - For end users all their traffic goes through an "exit node" to centralize risk.
    - Antennas are installed on a user's building as long as they have line-of-sight to the "supernode" rooftops
        - After they plug their antenna into their router it works similairly to a "normal" internet connection!  The router is exposed to the mesh network but individual devices are on their own LAN like normal.
    - For more advanced users / nodes we can set them up to directly expose individual devices within the mesh itself.
    - We're going to run IPV4 & IPV6 within the mesh
    - Currently we're in talks with Beanfield Metroconnect & BAI for internet access & mesh network backhauls.  Cisco has committed to let us have some space in their datacenter & use some of their hardware.

- **Tim: Engaging communities**
    - We need to actually reach out to people now!
        - There's a wide variety of contributions to be made in a few key areas
            - Mentoring and engaging with new participants
            - Connecting with media channels and community resources for digital literacy & related learning
            - Designing, authoring, and producing communications and learning materials
            - Ongoing dialogue, feedbakc, and decision making with participants of the network

- **Ben: Engaging communities**
    - We have three key objectives with the network
        - Local infrastructure in commons (citizen-owned networking infrastructure)
        - Digital inclusion and literacy
        - Citizen participation in public space
    - In order to promote these goals we need to build new spaces that support peer learning and access to networks
    - We've got to develop good governance practices for the network

- **Yurko: Provisioning services & support**
    - We still need to figure out the exact end-user experience
        - Hardware kit, instructions, how does support work?
    - We want to reach out to people to get connected!  Please allow us to help install nodes on your rooftops!

- **Tim: Public Engagement**
    - Serving communities is the first concern of the network and we really need new contributors.
        - Please point us towards resources for community building & new friends!

### Organizing Effectively and Sustainably

- Tim:
    - We need to set up working groups for:
        - Organization & program governance
            - Develop administrative processes ensuring Toronto Mesh meets their commitments. Attend to assets and resources. Assist in integrating and synthesizing priorities, plans and schedules across different disciplines and activities of the community network Formalize relationships and agreements with and within the community network
        - Network planning, design, and operations
            - Plan, design, implement and maintain a well-functioning community network.
        - Community outreach & communication
            - Connect with people living and working in the areas served by the network(s), inform people regarding intentions and activities of the community network and engage them in dialogue with a view to mutual learning and collaboration in advancing the value of the network and related opportunities in the community.
        - Project operations
            - Assist in organizing and removing barriers to the completion of work - including projects involving production of a funding application, design and deployment of network equipment, convening of meetings and workshops, etc.

## Discussion

- Felix: At Cisco we're trying to minimize the amount of times we have to go up on rooftops
- Tim: One of the great things about Toronto Mesh is that nobody needs any specialized skillsets to help us out!
- Dylan: Would like to organize a chat with a few folks - might have media contacts that are interested
- Dina: [Hack Club](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWFtj9cCaB0), electical eng, can do communications, raspberry pi, work on hardware discounts
- Cole: Deployments!
- Io: Illustration, UX design, some web dev experience
- Dante: Excited about recent progress since time off from parenting
- Pedro: Help with equipment, need to think on sustainability, deployment
- Elon: Excited, deploy on a roof, help with network
- Hank: Super stoked, refresh website, end user experience, peer with Io to work on website??
- Scott: Open source collective in OC, help with funding, broadly trying to get the word out, want to know timeline of deployment, media contacts
- Felix: Excited to see all the work ppl put in to make this happen
- Ben: Excited, great op at this moment, lots of background knowledge to draw from, excited to work with new ppl
- Tim: Tech moves so fast, ppl can't keep up on choices and impact, new phenomenon... excited about the inviting participation, huge impact to make big difference
