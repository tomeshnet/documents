# Code of Conduct Guidelines

Toronto Mesh consensed to actively use our first version of our code of conduct on [November 12, 2016](https://github.com/tomeshnet/documents/blob/master/meeting_notes/20161112_planning-meeting-notes.md)

## Code of Conduct

The Code of Conduct language is in our [documents](https://github.com/tomeshnet/documents/blob/master/CONDUCT.md) github repository and on our website at [tomesh.net/code-of-conduct/](https://tomesh.net/code-of-conduct/)

## Enforcement

[Enforcement guidelines](https://github.com/tomeshnet/documents/blob/master/CONDUCT.md#enforcement) are established in the Code of Conduct, with additional details provided below.

### Receiving Reports

(The following is included from [geekfeminism.wikia.com](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Responding_to_reports))

If someone reports harassment, ask for a written account of what happened. This should be **kept confidential** to as small a group as reasonably possible, and potentially anonymised by the receiving person before distribution to the closed group. If organizers receive a verbal report, they should themselves write down what they were told as soon as they can.

If the following information is not volunteered in a report, ask for it/include it, but do not pressure anyone:

- Identifying information (name/badge number) of the participant doing the harassing
- The behavior that was in violation
- The approximate time of the behavior (if different than the time the report was made)
- The circumstances surrounding the incident
- Other people involved in the incident

### Online Moderation

Online spaces maintained by Toronto Mesh (e.g. [chat.tomesh.net](https://chat.tomesh.net/)) are _also_ covered by our Code of Conduct.

Preliminary guidelines:

- Each publicly-listed [chat.tomesh.net](https://chat.tomesh.net/) room should have more than one moderator

### Email Reporting

Our `coc@tomesh.net` is monitored by two individuals on a rotating basis, new monitors will be determined at our planning meetings which occur roughly every six months.
