# Leadership

We reflected and discussed on governance during the [November 12 Planning Meeting](https://github.com/tomeshnet/documents/blob/master/meeting_notes/20161112_planning-meeting-notes.md) and consensed to refine our approach to governance as follows:

- Use the **working group** model:
  - Rotating leads who steer work and strategy within working groups, leads are _required_ to rotate out every planning meeting
  - Leads responsible and main point of contact for coordinating
- Stick to an established **meeting schedule**:
  - Monthly check-ins (casual, social and roughly an hour) for an update from working group leads
  - Six-month planning meeting, where we review previous roadmap and establish a new one, establish new leads and address any other issues
- Make use of our decentralized **collaboration tools**:
  - Working group areas on our chat and GitHub.

As per the 2018 November Planning Meeting:

- Only people who have been involved with Toronto Mesh for one cycle or longer will be assigned lead roles.

## Decision Making

Toronto Mesh uses voting to determine whether we have reached consensus:

- _Thumbs up_: go ahead, care about the issue and happy with direction
- _Closed fist_: "no-block"
- _Thumbs down_: needs more discussion, feel strongly enough to block
