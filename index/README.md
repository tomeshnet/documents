# Preface
For now this is where @hurricos is dumping different lists of sites
and what they're up to. @hurricos intends in the long-run to create or
contribute to a Mediawiki-based wiki to act as an "index" or
"directory" for anyone to get anywhere in the space of community
network projects.

## How should they be organized?
Put things into markdown by category (think: Mediawiki-based
Categories, like at the bottom of the [Mediawiki page for
categories](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Categories))

For now though I'm just stubbing in headers and listing the categories
below it in this readme. Organize it later.

# Media
- Simple things you can share with almost anyone

## Sudoroom's propaganda repo
https://github.com/sudomesh/propaganda
- Plenty of links here for stuff like stickers

## Tomesh / dasanchez' Presentation resources 
https://github.com/tomeshnet/tomesh.101/tree/master/presentations
- Great for presenting?? @hurricos hasn't checked this

# Mailing lists

## Sudoroom's mesh mailing list
https://sudoroom.org/pipermail/mesh/
- Fairly active it appears!

## Spinics linux wireless mailing list
https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-wireless/
- This is good for getting a pulse on how existing hardware is being
  maintained under Linux
  
## OpenWrt mailing list
https://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/openwrt-devel/
- OpenWrt is very popular and this mailing list is used by everyone
  for everything. 
  
# Hardware documentation

## Wikidevi
https://wikidevi.com
- This is dead since Hallowe'en 2019. This was the best resource for
  hardware info. The database logic that M86 created in it was
  migrated by and large to TechinfoDepot.

## Techinfodepot
http://en.techinfodepot.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Main_Page
- This is the inheritor of M86's
  wikidevi. [DarkShadow](http://en.techinfodepot.shoutwiki.com/wiki/User:DarkShadow)
  is the primary maintainer.
- @hurricos uses Firefox; he right clicked the search button on the
  left and "Add Keyword for this Search..." to "tech" so that he could
  search-bar "Tech Qualcomm Atheros" to get to [this
  page](http://en.techinfodepot.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Qualcomm_Atheros). This
  is incredibly useful whenever you need to find information about a
  particular chipset, SoC, vendor, driver, architecture. This is where
  everyone should put their data about hardware.
  
  
## Tomesh's stuff on Github
https://github.com/tomeshnet/documents/tree/master/technical
- These are mostly basically lab reports. Very very useful because
  they show practical implementations.
  
## (How to take pictures of hardware)
You should take pictures of hardware in very bright, very
point-source, very "angled" light. This makes it very clear to see the
stuff printed on the chip on top. See for example [this
picture](http://en.techinfodepot.shoutwiki.com/wiki/File:Meraki_MR24_PCB_Back.jpg)
taken by @hurricos on a Motorola Moto X Pure Edition (an $80 phone
these days). You can spot stuff even normal eyes can't see can't see.

# Mesh groups
