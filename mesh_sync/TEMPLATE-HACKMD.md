## What is this?

Biweekly open calls to sync up on topics relating to the global Community Network movement. The hours are selected to make it possible for parties of different timezones to attend.

Anyone may propose a topic on [this open-edit pad](https://hackmd.io/HSOK15u7TnS6Oz1RH0McGg), taking one of five session timeslots by putting yourself as _Facilitator_ and filling the corresponding [_Agenda_](#Agenda) section. You can see previous meeting notes on [tomeshnet/documents/mesh_sync](https://github.com/tomeshnet/documents/tree/master/mesh_sync) to get an idea of what type of topics have been discussed in the past.

Please scope your session within a 20 minute time block. If more time is needed, it is probably best to use the 20 minutes to give an overview, then schedule separate meetings with interested parties. The hope is that these standing hours can be well attended and everyone participating gets a general idea of global initiatives relating to the Community Network movement :satellite:
