## What is this?

Biweekly open calls to sync up on topics relating to the global Community Network movement. The hours are selected to make it possible for parties of different timezones to attend.

Anyone may propose a topic on [this open-edit pad](https://hackmd.io/HSOK15u7TnS6Oz1RH0McGg), taking one of five session timeslots by putting yourself as _Facilitator_ and filling the corresponding [_Agenda_](#Agenda) section. You can see previous meeting notes on [tomeshnet/documents/mesh_sync](https://github.com/tomeshnet/documents/tree/master/mesh_sync) to get an idea of what type of topics have been discussed in the past.

Please scope your session within a 20 minute time block. If more time is needed, it is probably best to use the 20 minutes to give an overview, then schedule separate meetings with interested parties. The hope is that these standing hours can be well attended and everyone participating gets a general idea of global initiatives relating to the Community Network movement :satellite:

#### Notes

- Quick conversation about "Bell Fibe" ("FTTN") vs "Bell Fiber" ("FTTH")
    - Gigabit speeds seem to only be attainable during Bell's speed test
    - Rock64 connected to 1gbps only does ~500mhz on "speedtest-cli"
    - iperf3 to vps node only hits ~110-150
    
- Discussion Around outreach projects to "ALT" isps
    - Teksavvy, Beanfield, swift
    - Need to have a more concrete concept to present
    - Discussed reasons for outreach to  tech-savvy, beanfield, SWIFT or other organizations and initiatives - what do we expect to achieve with building relationships like these? Agreed that it comes down to discovering opportunities for collaboration and mutual benefit and expanding TOMesh resources and knowledge.

    - Noted recent attendance at a information session about 5G testbed and innovation platform being rolled out along the 401 corridor from Waterloo to Quebec City.  See https://ontario.encqor.ca/ - offered this as an example resources being made available for innovative networking technology - even if not directly relevent to ToMesh.
    - Also, some of these organizations likely have some form of a community support/sustainability intention/mandate - SWIFT for instance, may have a community development mandate of some kind given the extent of government funding.
    

    - Our current activity is somewhat reactive and unfocused - recently lots of exploratoration,  learning & orienting with the DWeb and other complementary/parallel communities and interest-areas. However, there are some fundamental challenges we face in deploying DWeb protocols and apps over mesh networks.

    - We agreed that it would be better to formulate and develop several project plans - understanding that there is a diversity of interests represented among ToMesh collaborators. Proposed to develop a work-sheet analyzing some of the major technology challenges, and other project dimensions to help define a balanced set of projects (i.e. a user-driven project serving some value to a community, a technology-driven challenge, a fun project - more outreach/engagment oriented project, etc.)
    - Project idea: modified coolers facilitating a "picnic-oriented testing set-ups" in large public parks - have BBQ's and test meshnets.. (some concern raised over misunderstandings arising from technology loaded coolers - even though they would not be left unattended)

    - Proposal to approach the city and gain permission to undertake testing and temporary setups. For example, near FreeGeek/TMAC, there are light poles with AC power outlets that the city will rent for $10 per day.  Also, we have permission to temporarily install an small footprint antenna on the FreeGeek patio/balcony.

    - Can we do something for the OurNetworks event which will be at TMAC? Could we link to Beanfield? Would they supply bandwidth in support of the OurNetworks event?
- State-of-the-art protocols vs low-resource ones
    - CJDNS and YGG may be working against us
    - Tons of computing power required because encryption
    - Babel may not have addressing and encryption, but it works
-  DWEB apps not "mesh friendly"
    - lacks IPV6 support
    - Built for "traditional" infustructure
    - Example - IPFS not knowing topology 
        - Doesnt care who they take the data from from a topoplgy perspective
        - ISPs carry the backhaul burden
        - IE Level 3 probably only uses a small % of their capacity
        - Meshes have to shoulder that burden
    - Imagining a "caching" node for content on the roof of a Multi Dwelling Unit
        - Encryption makes caching impossible
        - Suggestion - perhaps homogeneous encryption has a place here
- Prototype and SSB for TPL 
    - SSB does listen for IPv6 announcement packets :( 
    - Work around are
        - Invite to ipv6 cjdns peer
        - Add ipv4 address to wlan0 interface to bypass cjdns ipv6 address
- Burlington, VT project for [The Ramble](https://theramble.org/) - MESH ice cast audio stream
    - Long buffer to allow for roaming
    - Pis runing 5v batteries
    - MR16 mesh

#### Important things for future Syncs
- Taking notes
- Making the output freely available
  - That is to say, organize and publish the notes that come out of it, as before
- Advertise beforehand
    - Decide on time earlier
- Improve chat
  - Jitsi just wasn't working - would Mumble be better? What type of chat would be better?
    - Suggestion: Multi-modal chat (attendees can talk chat in a voice chatroom, and a stream of the chat is published so people can involve themselves via a text chatroom)
